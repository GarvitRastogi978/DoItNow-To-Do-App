## 📌 Project Overview

This To-Do List application helps users manage daily tasks efficiently by combining **task tracking**, **time monitoring**, and **deadline awareness** in a single system.

Each user has a **private workspace**, where tasks are stored securely and tracked individually.

The project is designed with **scalability and clean architecture** in mind, making it suitable for:

*   College projects
    
*   Resume & portfolio
    
*   Entry-level software engineering roles
    

* * *

## 🎯 Aim

To design and develop a **secure, responsive, and feature-rich task management system** using Python that reflects real-world application development practices.

* * *

## 🧠 Objectives

*   Implement secure user authentication
    
*   Perform CRUD operations using SQLite
    
*   Track task deadlines and time spent
    
*   Build a dynamic, responsive UI
    
*   Apply clean project structure and modular coding
    
*   Create a resume-worthy Python project

## ⚙️ How It Works

1.  User registers or logs in securely
    
2.  Session is created and maintained
    
3.  User can add tasks with priority & due date
    
4.  Smart reminders detect overdue tasks
    
5.  Time tracking records time spent per task
    
6.  All data is stored persistently in SQLite
    
7.  User can logout safely
